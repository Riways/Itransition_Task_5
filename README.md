The "Infinite User Data Generator" program is a powerful tool that allows users to generate an unlimited amount of user data for three different countries - Poland, Latwia, France. The program is designed to create realistic user data that is specific to each country, including names, addresses and phone numbers.

One of the key features of the program is its ability to introduce a specific amount of errors or mistakes in the generated data. This can be useful for testing or training purposes, as it allows users to simulate different error scenarios and evaluate how their system or algorithm handles them.

The program is highly customizable, allowing users to specify the country, the number of mistakes, and the seed value for the data generation process. The seed value ensures that all generated data and mistakes are consistent and repeatable, which is important for testing and debugging.

Overall, the Infinite User Data Generator is a powerful tool that can save users a lot of time and effort in creating realistic user data for testing and training purposes. Its user-friendly interface and customizable options make it a valuable asset for developers, researchers, and data analysts.
